%   microCzar
%
%   microCzar is a lightweight MATLAB package for organizing data and code.
%   It provides a simple interface to existing tools, and focuses on not
%   duplicating their functionality.
%
%   Requirements:
%
%       To use microCzar you'll need to do some system setup. It varies by
%       type of system, but will work in Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
%
%       git - Git is a version control system that you should use to keep
%       track of your code. You can download it here: 
%           http://git-scm.com/downloads
%       You should also setup an account on GitHub, a free service that
%       works with git to keep off-site backups of your code.

%
%       rsync - Rsync is a powerful file synchronization tool that compares
%       local and remote directories, and transmits only parts of files
%       that have changed.

%
%       ssh - SSH is a program for secure remote logins. git and rsync both
%       use SSH to allow you to login to your backup servers without typing
%       in a password.
